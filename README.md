# Deepin_Linux
This is my personal folder for Deepin Scripts

I made two different script:
- "Deepin force local mirror.sh": this is a simple script that allow international users to force Deepin to use a local server;
- "Deepin post installazione.sh": this is a particular script for Italian users, in order to set italian GARR Mirror and install some interesting software.

Have a nice day!
